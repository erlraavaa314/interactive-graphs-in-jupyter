Created this repository for easy access for anyone who is interested.
Upploaded the old file from before Christmas on how to select nodes in a graph by clicking near them. This is 
the file called widgetsandpyplotlib(1).ipynb

Current goal(s):
    -Create a jupyter notebook where a collection of nodes can be selected by a rectangle.
    -Create a jupyter notebook where a collection of nodes can be selected by a lasso.
    
Achieved goal(s):
    -Created a jupyter notebook where nodes can be selected individually by mouseclicks.
